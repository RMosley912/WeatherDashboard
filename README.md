# Weather App

## Overview

This application is a straightforward weather dashboard that provides current and future weather info based on a city name that is type in. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current day's high temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with a 5-day forecast. 

Also, the application also features a search history panel, where the users can see their previously searched cities and click on them to retrieve their respective data.
