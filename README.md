# Weather App

## Overview

This application is a straightforward weather dashboard that provides current and future weather info based on a city name that is type in. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current day's high temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with a 5-day forecast. 

Also, the application also features a search history panel, where the users can see their previously searched cities and click on them to retrieve their respective data. 

The design and layout of the application are made easy to navigate using Bootstrap. The color scheme should remind you of the sun and blue sky.
